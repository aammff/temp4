RÃ³Å¼nice miÄ™dzy zwrotami polskimi

Both phrases, **"skÄ…d siÄ™ to wziÄ™Å‚o"** and **"skÄ…d to siÄ™ wziÄ™Å‚o"**, are grammatically correct in Polish and mean essentially the same thing: **"Where did this come from?"** or **"What is the origin of this?"** However, there is a slight difference in emphasis and naturalness depending on the context.

### 1. **"SkÄ…d siÄ™ to wziÄ™Å‚o?"**  
- This word order is slightly more **neutral** and **commonly used in speech**.  
- The verb **"wziÄ™Å‚o" (took itself)** is reflexive, and the reflexive pronoun **"siÄ™"** is placed **before** the subject ("to").  
- It sounds very natural and fluid in everyday Polish.

### 2. **"SkÄ…d to siÄ™ wziÄ™Å‚o?"**  
- This version places **"to" (this/that)** earlier, which gives it a slight **emphasis on "to"**.  
- This might be used when you are **particularly focusing on "this" specific thing** rather than the general concept.  
- While still correct, it is slightly less frequent than the first version in casual speech.

### Summary:  
Both forms are interchangeable, but:
- **"SkÄ…d siÄ™ to wziÄ™Å‚o?"** â€“ More natural, neutral phrasing.  
- **"SkÄ…d to siÄ™ wziÄ™Å‚o?"** â€“ Puts a bit more emphasis on "to" (this particular thing).
